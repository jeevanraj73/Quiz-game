**Project Description: Quiz Game in C**

This project implements a simple console-based quiz game written in C. The game features a menu-driven interface that allows users to start the game, view the highest score, reset scores, seek help, or quit. It includes a two-stage gameplay process:

1. **Warmup Round**: Players answer 3 general knowledge questions. To proceed to the main game, they must answer at least 2 questions correctly.
   
2. **Challenge Round**: Eligible players answer 10 questions with multiple-choice answers. Each correct answer awards points, and the player can win a cash prize based on their score.

The game also supports score management, including displaying the highest score, resetting scores, and updating scores based on player performance. The program uses basic file operations to store and retrieve scores and employs simple console inputs and outputs to interact with the player.
